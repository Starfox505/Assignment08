			<h3>Reading</h3>
			<p>I try to read at least 30 minutes every day. I read to relax before bed and on my lunch breaks. I enjoy
				science fiction, horror, and satirical fiction. My favorite authors are Chuck Palahniuk, Shirley
				Jackson, and Arthur C. Clarke.</p>

			<h3>Exercising</h3>
			<p>I like to ride my bike, go for short runs, and lift weights in my home gym. I have bike trainer at home
				that I use when it's too hot or cold to ride outside. I do my best to be active and stay in shape.</p>

			<h3>Spending Time With My Dogs</h3>
			<p>I love spending time with my dogs. I take them to the dog park every Saturday and my wife and we take
				them on trips with us to dog-friendly locations whenever we can find a weekend to get away. They are
				very spoiled and we consider them a part of our family.</p>
